# CustomIpGeolocationProvider for Bulksign platform
This is sample code that demonstrates how to implement a custom ip geolocation provider for the [Bulksign](https://bulksign.com) platform.

The code itself is very simple. This references the Bulksign.Extensibility library from NuGet and contains a class that implements the IIPGeolocation interface. 

```
public class CustomIpGeolocationProvider : IIPGeolocation
```
